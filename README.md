Konnect is a website intended for university students in the lower mainland to buy, sell, or trade goods and services such as textbooks and tutoring services. Users post their listings, and other users can contact them and negotiate an exchange/purchase; this is similar to craigslist, but with the requirement that one needs a student email from UBC, SFU, KPU, or BCIT in order to sign up. The intention behind this requirement is to provide additional legitimacy behind eachlisting; however, this requirement is not currently enforced in order to allow you to test all the site's features.

This web application was written in Java, and also uses Expression Language (EL) and JSP to dynamically generate user-visible content. I wrote the Java and EL code, while credit for the CSS and HTML goes to my partners: Navdeep Singh, Rajan Boughan, Kevin Noyes, and Rayzel Linag.
